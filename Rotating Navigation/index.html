        7 Tips for Writing a Good Article Quickly
        In the age of the internet, article writers who can generate good content in a short time period are in increasingly high demand. However, writing articles or blogging under tight deadlines should not come at the expense of good writing. Here is a step-by-step guide full of great tips to help you write a good article in record time:

        1. Keep a list of ideas handy. You never know when writer’s block will hit. That’s why it’s important to keep a list of ideas for potential news articles or personal stories that could be expanded into essays. Any time you have an idea, jot it down in a notebook or in a Word document on your computer. That way, when it’s time to start writing, you’ll already have a place to start.

        2. Eliminate distractions. A lot of people claim to work better while multitasking. Rarely is this actually the case, especially if the goal is to write an entire article in a short amount of time. The best articles require your complete and undivided attention. Before you begin writing your first sentence, turn off the TV and mute social media so you can focus solely on article writing.

        3. Research efficiently. Research is important for any piece of writing, but it’s also easy to fall into the trap of spending too much time researching and not enough time writing your first draft. If you’re looking for facts or statistics to support your argument, try to be as specific as possible in your search terms. If you aren’t finding the support you’re looking for, the takeaway may be that you need to adjust your thesis or subject matter.

        4. Keep it simple. A reader’s attention span is generally short, so one of the best things that you can do as a writer is to keep your article direct and concise. Having a maximum word count goal will help you not only help you complete your write-ups faster, but it will also result in a streamlined article that focuses on major points while eliminating fluff.

        5. Try writing in bullet points. Writing in bullet points can help you organize your thoughts and complete the article faster. Also, bullet point articles often drive higher traffic, since search engine algorithms tend to prioritize articles with bullet points and subheadings. Writing in bullet points is not only a time-saver, it can also increase the likelihood your article reaching your target audience.
      </p>

        6. Edit after writing. One of the most common mistakes that writers make is trying to edit while they write. Resist this urge. Trying to edit while in the process of writing can slow you down, increasing the likelihood that you won’t even make it past the intro. Good writers know that writing and editing are two distinct and separate processes. Once you’ve gotten to the end, then you can go back and focus on writing the perfect first line, sharpening your first paragraph, or tying things together with a clever kicker.

        7. Set a timer. A great way to become a quicker and more efficient writer is to practice writing to a timer. Set a timer for 30 minutes and see how much you can get done. You’ll be surprised how much you can produce during a half hour of focused, uninterrupted writing.
